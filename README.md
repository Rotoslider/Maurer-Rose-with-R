# Maurer-Rose-with-R
I Gui in R for Maurer Rose patterns and saving them as png and SVG files for laser engraving etc. 
## Overview

This Shiny app provides an interactive visualization of the Maurer Rose, a mathematical curve which is a combination of a rose, described by the polar equation `r = sin(nÎ¸)`, and a Maurer curve, which plots lines to points along the rose.

## Features

- **N Slider**: Adjusts the 'n' parameter in the rose equation. Changing 'n' alters the number of petals in the rose pattern.
- **D Slider**: Modifies the 'd' parameter, which influences the density and complexity of the Maurer curve.
- **Maurer Connection Angle Slider**: Controls the angular increment for drawing lines in the Maurer curve, affecting the visual structure of the pattern.
- **Size Slider**: Changes the overall size of the rose.
- **GG Slider**: Modifies an additional size parameter, fine-tuning the rose's radius.
- **Colorize Checkbox**: Toggles colorization of the lines, adding a vibrant look to the pattern.
- **Draw Rose Checkbox** Toggles the Maurer rose pattern. When checked, the app draws a variant of the Maurer rose that focuses more on the rose curve itself.
- **Step Slider**: Alters the angular step for plotting points, significantly changing the rose's shape and pattern.
- **Randomize Button**: Randomly adjusts all sliders to create unique and unexpected patterns.
- **Save Button**: Saves the current visualization as PNG and SVG files.

## Brief History of the Maurer Rose

The Maurer Rose is named after Peter M. Maurer who described it in 1987. It is a fascinating mathematical visualization that combines simplicity and complexity, resulting in beautiful patterns that resemble roses. The curve is generated by plotting lines to points along a rose curve, which is itself a well-known mathematical curve resembling a flower's petals.

## Installation and Running the App

### Prerequisites

- R (version 3.6.0 or later)
- RStudio (recommended for ease of use)

### Required R Packages

Install the following R packages:

```R
install.packages(c("shiny", "svglite", "png", "ggplot2"))
```
